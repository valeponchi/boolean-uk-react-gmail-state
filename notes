Description
In this exercise, we are going to practice using state.

We'll use state to render a list of emails like in Gmail, rendering lists is a very common pattern in React.

We'll use state's set function to modify data and render the new changes.

Instructions
- ✅Download files from => https://codesandbox.io/s/react-gmail-state-starter-7o07o?file=/src/App.js
- ✅DO NOT break the code down into components; work in App.js only
- ✅Set state using useState and intialEmails
- ✅Render a list of emails from state so it looks similar to the screenshot that comes with this message
- ✅Create a toggleRead function that updates the target email's read property in state, when a user clicks on the checkbox
- ✅Create a toggleStar function that updates the target email's starred property in state, when a user clicks on the star
- ✅Make sure these changes take effect in the UI

Tips
- You can ignore the Header component for now
- You can use the CSS in app.css to help style your list of emails or create your own styles
- Array.map is a useful method for rendering lists and modifying state
- Remember to use the key attribute when rendering lists in react

Challenge 1
- Get the Hide Read checkbox to work in the left-menu section. You'll need to use state to keep track of the changes and you'll need a function to filter the emails before they are rendered ie. getReadEmails(emails)

Challenge 2
- Get the left-menu inbox and starred menu items to work when clicked. You'll need to use state to keep track of the changes ie. currentTab and you'll need a function to filter the emails before they are rendered ie. getStarredEmails(emails)

- Replace the hard-coded question marks in the left-menu
